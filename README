funkjs

A sweet selection of JavaScript funky function extensions that let you do all sorts of nice things when coding JavaScript.

For a list of capabilities, check out the tests: https://github.com/matryer/funkjs/tree/master/test/tests

funk.bind - Binds context (this) and arguments to a function
funk.block - Blocks a function to prevent it from doing anything
funk.chain - Chains two or more functions together
funk.clean - Removes all funky magic from a function (i.e. reverts it back to before any funk operations)
funk.times - Returns a function that calls the original function a specific number of times
funk.track - Keeps track of all calls to the function (great for testing)


And some internal stuff:

funk.functions - Gathers all functions from arguments and arrays
